If the angle between two vectors is $0^\\circ$ then all of the first vector lies along the second vector and the dot product is the product of their lengths. So the dot product depends on both factors: 1. how much of one vector lies along the other and 2. the length of the other vector.\n",

That's why we will draw a cylinder instead of an arrow.\n",
